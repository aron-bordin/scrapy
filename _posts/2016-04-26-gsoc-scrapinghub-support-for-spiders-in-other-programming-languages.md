Hello Everyone !

My name is Aron Bordin and I’m Brazilian Computer Science Student and AI Researcher. I’m studying Computer Science at São Paulo State University, and always coding something fun on my free-time :)

I'm very happy to announce that my Google Summer of Code proposal has been accepted :tada:

## About this Project

Scrapy is one of the most popular web crawling and web scraping framework. It’s written in Python and known by its good performance, simplicity, and powerful API. However, it’s only possible to write scrapy’s Spiders using the Python Language.

The goal of this project is to provide an interface that allows developers to write spiders using any programming language, using json objects to make requests, parse web contents, get data, and more.  Also, a helper library will be available for Java, JS, and R.
