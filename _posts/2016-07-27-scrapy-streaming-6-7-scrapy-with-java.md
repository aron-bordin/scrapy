Hi,

In these weeks, I've implemented the Java library to develop Scrapy's Spider. Now, you can develop scrapy spiders easily
using the ``scrapystreaming`` lib.

## About

It's a helper library to help the development process of external spiders in Java. It allows you to create the scrapy streaming json messages using Java objects and methods.


## Docs

You can read the official docs here: [http://gsoc2016.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java.html](http://gsoc2016.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java.html)

## Examples

I've added a few examples about it, and a quickstart section in the documentation.
