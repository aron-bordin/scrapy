Hello,

In these weeks, I've added support for R Language on Scrapy Streaming. Now, you can develop scrapy spiders easily
using the ``scrapystreaming`` R package.

## About

It's a helper library to help the development process of external spiders in R. It allows you to create the scrapy streaming json messages using R commands.


## Docs

You can read the official docs here: [http://gsoc2016.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r.html](http://gsoc2016.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r.html)

## Examples

I've added a few examples about it, and a quickstart section in the documentation.
